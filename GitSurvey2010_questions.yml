    Note that above choices are neither orthogonal nor exclusive.

- Q8
- title: '08. How do/did you obtain Git (install and/or upgrade)?'
  codes:
    - binary package
    - source package or script
    - source tarball
    - pull from (main) repository
    - preinstalled / sysadmin job
    - 'other - please specify (if none of the above apply)'
  other: 1
  multi: 1
  description: |
    Explanation: binary package covers pre-compiled binary (e.g. from rpm
    or deb binary packages); source package covers things like deb-src and
    SRPMS/*.src.rpm; source script is meant to cover installation in
    source-based distributions, like 'emerge' in Gentoo.
    
    Automatic update (apt, yum, etc.) in most cases means binary package
    install; unless one uses source-based distribution like Gentoo, CRUX,
    or SourceMage, where automatic update means using source package (or
    source script).
    
    The option named "preinstalled / sysadmin job" means that either you
    didn't need to install git because it was preinstalled (and you didn't
    upgrade); or that you have to ask system administrator to have git
    installed or upgraded.
    
    Note that this question is multiple choices question because one can
    install Git in different ways on different machines or on different
    operating systems.

  description: |
    This question asks about how do you get changes (updates) from
    projects you follow into your local repository. It is not about how do
    you get latest version of Git.
    
    Fetching (or rather cloning) via bundle could mean that project
    publishes ready for download bundles to reduce traffic and load on
    server (HTTP download [of bundle] can be resumed, git-clone currently
    cannot; one can also distribute bundle using P2P).
- Q15
- title: '15. How do you publish/propagate your changes?'
  codes:
    - push
    - pull request (+ any form of announcement / notification)
    - format-patch + email
    - 'format-patch + other (e.g. reviewboard, issue tracker or forum)'
    - git bundle
    - git-svn (to Subversion repository)
    - git-p4 (to Perforce repository)
    - foreign SCM interface (other than mentioned above)
    - 'other - please specify'
  multi: 1
  other: 1
  description: |
    Publishing via bundle could mean sending bundle via email, or posting
    it on review board (or forum).

    Instead of git-format-patch there can be utilized other way of
    generating patch (e.g. git-show, git-diff, 'patch' view from
    gitweb, etc.)
