Scripts used to analyze results of Git User's Surveys
=====================================================

Here you can find scripts used to analyze results (from data exported
from survey site in CSV format) of "Git User's Survey" from various
years.  You can also find _some_ of assorted data used by those
scripts; the rest can be found on relevant pages on Git Wiki.

* survey_parse_survey.net.nz.perl was used to analyze results of 
  "Git User's Survey 2007", and generate data used to create
  https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSurvey2007 (which page
  also contains link to CSV file with exported survey results)

  "Git User's Survey 2007" was hosted on now defunct 
  http://www.survey.net.nz/

* survey_parse_Survs.com.perl was used to analyze results of
  "Git User's Survey 2008", and generate data used to create
  https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitSurvey2008

* survey_parse_Survs.com_CSV-Num.perl was used to analyze results
  from 2009 and 2010 survey.  It is cleaner rewrite of earlier
  survey_parse_Survs.com.perl script.


Those scripts were used to generate table with results for each
question (how many times each answer was selected), similarly to
'Analyze' page on Survs.com, but it can also normalize and tabularize
free-form responses.
